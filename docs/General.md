Backstab
==========

Backstab provides enhancements to Backbone.js.

Index
-------
    
- ``Backstab.View``. Makes a number of enhancements to the standard `Backbone.View` `events` hash.
- ``Backstab.Dispatcher``. Provides a way for views to communicate without directly referencing each other.
- ``Backstab.StateMachine``. A state machine that provides Backbone.js-style functionality.
- ``Backstab.Foo``. An example sub-class that can be used as a guideline for creating your own Backstab sub-classes.
- ``Backstab.family``. Groups a family of models, collections, and views under one namespace.
- ``Backstab`` (Core). The main Backstab object provides the namespace for the various Backstab sub-classes. It also offers loading/override functionality if you want to use the standard Backbone namespace.
- ``Backstab`` (Underscore.js Enhancements). Backstab adds some more utility functions to the Underscore.js namespace.
